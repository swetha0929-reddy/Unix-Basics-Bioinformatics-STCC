## Unix Basics Practice
Basic Unix commands were practiced to understand file system navigation and file handling.

Commands practiced include:
- `pwd`, `ls`
- `mkdir`, `cd`
- `echo`, `cat`
- `wc`
- `grep`
- `mv`, `cp`, `rm`

A simple text file was created and modified to practice searching and counting text using Unix utilities.

## FASTA File Practice

### Sample FASTA File
A small FASTA file (`sample.fasta`) was manually created to understand FASTA structure:
- FASTA headers begin with `>`
- Sequence data follows each header

Commands were used to:
- Count the number of sequences
- Count nucleotide characters

### Real Biological FASTA Data
Real biological FASTA files were analyzed:
- `tb1.fasta` (DNA)
- `tb1-protein.fasta` (Protein)
- `tga1-protein.fasta` (Protein)

Analyses performed:
- Inspection of FASTA headers using `head`
- Counting the number of sequences using `grep` and `wc`
- Estimating total nucleotide count
- Comparing file sizes using `ls -lh`

These tasks demonstrate how Unix tools are applied in real bioinformatics workflows.

## Conclusion
This project strengthened practical Unix skills essential for bioinformatics.  
The exercises demonstrated how simple Unix commands can efficiently analyze biological sequence data and form the foundation of larger bioinformatics pipelines.
